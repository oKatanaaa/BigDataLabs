## Launching

Everything is done using PySpark docker.

To launch the docker use the following command:
`docker-compose up --build -d`

All the necessary files for the labs must be placed in `data` folder near `lab1_apache_spark` and `lab2_apache_reports` folders.
If the docker is being launched in Windows, it is highly recommended to allocated at least 8GB of RAM for the docker engine, otherwise it may not launch.
